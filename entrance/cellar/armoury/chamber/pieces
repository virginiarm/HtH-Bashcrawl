    cat << EOF > corpse
You see the corpse of a slain adventurer on the floor of the
dungeon.  You find the following items on the corpse:  

$I

EOF
    curr=`basename $PWD`
    while [ "$curr" != "entrance" ]; do
        pushd .. &> /dev/null
        dirs -c
        curr=`basename $PWD`
    done
    unset I
    unset HP
    $SHELL
}

# this runs after the statue has been "destroyed"
# and this file has been renamed to 'pieces'
if [ "$0" = "./pieces" ]; then
    cat << EOF
You sift through the pieces of a shattered statue.

You find nothing of interest in the statue's remains.

EOF
    exit 1
fi

# start the statue encounter
cat << EOF
A rugged statue stands in the corner of the room.

EOF
printf "Do you approach it? "

read RESP

if [ "$RESP" = "y" -o "$RESP" = "Y" ]; then
    cat << EOF
The statue springs to life, rumbling:

WHO DARES INTRUDE UPON THE CHAMBER OF SPIRITS?

It thrusts a fist at you, hitting you for 5 damage.

EOF

    # this does not change the user's HP,
    # it only calculates it after damage
    let "HP=HP-5"
    if [ "$HP" -le 0 ]; then
        cat << EOF
You have been slain by the statue.

GAME OVER!

EOF
        gameover
        exit 1
    fi

    perl -pe 's/coins/diamonds/' -i ./treasure
    printf "Do you have a sword? "
    read RESP
    if [ "$RESP" = "y" -o "$RESP" = "Y" ]; then
       if grep  --quiet --only-matching 'sword' <<< $I; then
           cat <<EOF
You strike the statue and it breaks to pieces!

However, you have taken damage.
Deduct 5 from your HP variable:

let "HP=HP-5"

EOF
           mv statue pieces
       else
           cat << EOF
No you don't!  Run!
You have taken damage from the animated statue.
Deduct 5 from your HP variable:

let "HP=HP-5"

EOF
           rm treasure
           rm spell
      fi
    else
        cat <<EOF
Run!
You have taken damage from the animated statue.
Deduct 5 from your HP variable:

let "HP=HP-5"

EOF
   fi
else
    cat << EOF
You cautiously avoid the statue, recalling stories of living
stone lying in wait, deep within haunted catacombs.
